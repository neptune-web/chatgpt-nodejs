# ChatGPT API Server

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm
- An account with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat)
- A valid [NopeCHA](https://nopecha.com/) API key

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Create a file `settings.js` in the root directory with the following contents:
```JS
module.exports = {
    port: 3000, // the port the server will run on (optional, defaults to 3000)
    accounts: [ // an array of objects representing your ChatGPT accounts
        {
            email: 'your-email@example.com',
            password: 'your-password',
            proxy: 'your-proxy-server-url (optional)'
        },
        // add more accounts as needed...
    ],
    nopechaKey: 'your-nopecha-key' // your NopeCHA API key
}
```
4. Start the server with `node index.js`

## Usage
To start a conversation with ChatGPT, send a POST request to the server's `/conversation` endpoint with a JSON body in the following format:
```
{
    "message": "Hello, how are you today?",
    "conversationId": "your-conversation-id (optional)",
    "parentMessageId": "your-parent-message-id (optional)"
}
```
The server will return a JSON object containing ChatGPT's response:
```
{
    "response": "I'm doing well, thank you! How are you?",
    "conversationId": "your-conversation-id",
    "messageId": "your-message-id"
}
```

If the request is unsuccessful, the server will return a JSON object with an error message and a status code of 503:
```
{
    "error": "No sessions available."
}
```
```
{
    "error": "There was an error communicating with ChatGPT."
}
```
