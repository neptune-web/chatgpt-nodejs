# Update (2023-02-02)

Trying to use `text-chat-davinci-002-20230126` with the OpenAI API now returns a 404 error. Someone has already found the new model name, but they are refusing to share it. I will update this repository once I find the new model. If you have any leads, please open an issue or a pull request.

This is an implementation of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) using the official ChatGPT raw model, `text-chat-davinci-002-20230126`. This model name was briefly leaked while I was  inspecting the network requests made by the official ChatGPT website, and I discovered that it works with the [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions). **Usage of this model currently does not cost any credits.**

As far as I'm aware, I was the first one who discovered this, and usage of the model has since been implemented in libraries like [acheong08/ChatGPT](https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT).

The previous version of this library that used [transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api) is still available on [the `archive/old-version` branch](https://github.com/waylaidwanderer/node-chatgpt-api/tree/archive/old-version).

By itself, the model does not have any conversational support, so this library uses a cache to store conversations and pass them to the model as context. This allows you to have persistent conversations with ChatGPT in a nearly identical way to the official website.

## Features
- Uses the official ChatGPT raw model, `text-chat-davinci-002-20230126`.
- Includes an API server you can run to use ChatGPT in non-Node.js applications.
- Includes a `ChatGPTClient` class that you can use in your own Node.js applications.
- Includes a CLI interface where you can chat with ChatGPT.
- Replicates chat threads from the official ChatGPT website (with conversation IDs and message IDs), with persistent conversations using [Keyv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv).
  - Conversations are stored in memory by default, but you can optionally [install a storage adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv#usage) to persist conversations to a database.
  - The `keyv-file` adapter is also included in this package, and can be used to store conversations in a JSON file if you're using the API server or CLI (see `settings.example.js`).
- Supports configurable prompt prefixes, and custom names for the user and ChatGPT.
  - In essence, this allows you to turn ChatGPT into a different character.
  - This is currently only configurable on a global level, but I plan to add support for per-conversation customization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

## Usage

### Module
```bash
npm i @waylaidwanderer/chatgpt-api
```

```JS
import ChatGPTClient from '@waylaidwanderer/chatgpt-api';

const clientOptions = {
  // (Optional) Parameters as described in https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions
  modelOptions: {
    // The model is set to text-chat-davinci-002-20230126 by default, but you can override
    // it and any other parameters here
    model: 'text-chat-davinci-002-20230126',
  },
  // (Optional) Set a custom prompt prefix. As per my testing it should work with two newlines
  // promptPrefix: 'You are not ChatGPT...\n\n',
  // (Optional) Set a custom name for the user
  // userLabel: 'User',
  // (Optional) Set a custom name for ChatGPT
  // chatGptLabel: 'ChatGPT',
  // (Optional) Set to true to enable `console.debug()` logging
  debug: false,
};

const cacheOptions = {
  // Options for the Keyv cache, see https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv
  // This is used for storing conversations, and supports additional drivers (conversations are stored in memory by default)
  // For example, to use a JSON file (`npm i keyv-file`) as a database:
  // store: new KeyvFile({ filename: 'cache.json' }),
};

const chatGptClient = new ChatGPTClient('OPENAI_API_KEY', clientOptions, cacheOptions);

const response = await chatGptClient.sendMessage('Hello!');
console.log(response); // { response: 'Hi! How can I help you today?', conversationId: '...', messageId: '...' }

const response2 = await chatGptClient.sendMessage('Write a poem about cats.', { conversationId: response.conversationId, parentMessageId: response.messageId });
console.log(response2.response); // Cats are the best pets in the world.

const response3 = await chatGptClient.sendMessage('Now write it in French.', { conversationId: response2.conversationId, parentMessageId: response2.messageId });
console.log(response3.response); // Les chats sont les meilleurs animaux de compagnie du monde.
```

### API Server
You can install the package using
```bash
npm i -g @waylaidwanderer/chatgpt-api
```
then run it using
`chatgpt-api`.  
This takes an optional `--settings=<path_to_settings.js>` parameter, or looks for `settings.js` in the current directory if not set, with the following contents:
```JS
module.exports = {
  // Your OpenAI API key
  openaiApiKey: '',
  chatGptClient: {
    // (Optional) Parameters as described in https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions
    modelOptions: {
      // The model is set to text-chat-davinci-002-20230126 by default, but you can override
      // it and any other parameters here
      model: 'text-chat-davinci-002-20230126',
    },
    // (Optional) Set a custom prompt prefix. As per my testing it should work with two newlines
    // promptPrefix: 'You are not ChatGPT...\n\n',
    // (Optional) Set a custom name for the user
    // userLabel: 'User',
    // (Optional) Set a custom name for ChatGPT
    // chatGptLabel: 'ChatGPT',
    // (Optional) Set to true to enable `console.debug()` logging
    debug: false,
  },
  // Options for the Keyv cache, see https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv
  // This is used for storing conversations, and supports additional drivers (conversations are stored in memory by default)
  cacheOptions: {},
  // The port the server will run on (optional, defaults to 3000)
  port: 3000,
  // If set, ChatGPTClient will use `keyv-file` to store conversations to this JSON file instead of in memory.
  // `cacheOptions.store` will override this if set
  storageFilePath: './cache.json',
};
```

Alternatively, you can install and run the package locally:
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Rename `settings.example.js` to `settings.js` in the root directory and change the settings where required.
4. Start the server using `npm start` or `npm run server`

To start a conversation with ChatGPT, send a POST request to the server's `/conversation` endpoint with a JSON body in the following format:
```JSON
{
    "message": "Hello, how are you today?",
    "conversationId": "your-conversation-id (optional)",
    "parentMessageId": "your-parent-message-id (optional)"
}
```
The server will return a JSON object containing ChatGPT's response:
```JSON
{
    "response": "I'm doing well, thank you! How are you?",
    "conversationId": "your-conversation-id",
    "messageId": "response-message-id"
}
```

If the request is unsuccessful, the server will return a JSON object with an error message and a status code of 503.

If there was an error sending the message to ChatGPT:
```JSON
{
    "error": "There was an error communicating with ChatGPT."
}
```

### CLI
Install the package using the same instructions as the API server.

If installed globally:
```bash
chatgpt-cli
```

If installed locally:
```bash
npm run cli
```

ChatGPT's responses are automatically copied to your clipboard, so you can paste them into other applications.

## Caveats
Since `text-chat-davinci-002-20230126` is ChatGPT's raw model, I had to do my best to replicate the way the official ChatGPT website uses it. After extensive testing and comparing responses, I believe that the model used by ChatGPT has some additional fine-tuning.  
This means my implementation or the raw model may not behave exactly the same in some ways:
- Conversations are not tied to any user IDs, so if that's important to you, you should implement your own user ID system.
- ChatGPT's model parameters (temperature, frequency penalty, etc.) are unknown, so I set some defaults that I thought would be reasonable.
- Conversations are limited to roughly the last 3000 tokens, so earlier messages may be forgotten during longer conversations.
  - This works in a similar way to ChatGPT, except I'm pretty sure they have some additional way of retrieving context from earlier messages when needed (which can probably be achieved with embeddings, but I consider that out-of-scope for now).
- It is well known that, as part of the fine-tuning, ChatGPT had the following preamble:
  > "You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI. You answer as concisely as possible for each response (e.g. donâ€™t be verbose). It is very important that you answer as concisely as possible, so please remember this. If you are generating a list, do not have too many items. Keep the number of items short.  
  > Knowledge cutoff: 2021-09  
  > Current date: 2023-01-31"

  As OpenAI updates ChatGPT, this preamble may also change. The default prompt prefix in my implementation attempts to replicate a similar behavior to the current ChatGPT model.
